vipcw-spectrogram
=================

This project will sample a .wav file using an fft and afterwardsc
represent it in a graphical manner to be used on a Raspberry Pi.

After using an fft to transform a signal from the time domain to the frequency
domain, we can use a python script to show the spectrogram.
